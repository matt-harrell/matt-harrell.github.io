The desired outcome for this app is to persuade vaccine hesitant parents that vaccines are not just for their children but are needed to protect other children who can’t get vaccinated. Within the app, I used different storytelling techniques and interactive experiences to build to build an empathic argument that vaccines are needed for herd immunity.",
